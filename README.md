# Cobalt - Work in Progress

Cobalt is a web-based platform for the administration and running of [the game of bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_bridge). It is expected to be complete in 2021.

Cobalt will manage all aspects of bridge administration for players, clubs, state organisations and national
organisations. This includes payments, event entry, club membership, discussion forums, masterpoints, results and scoring.
Cobalt will be extended to include teaching and online bridge once the core functions have been developed.

Initial development of Cobalt is funded by the [Australian Bridge Federation](http://abf.com.au).
