Manual function to generate random users - required for testing manual
payment searches.
Search for user in Admin added (search by ABF Number or last name)
Removed hardcoded references to ABF, now controlled as a system setting,
with the exception of the MasterPoints interface which will change later.
Put the default avatar into static and set up a copy step to media so we
have it for all new installs.
Fixed direct /static references. This could break things especially in
registration but if it does it will be big and obvious.
