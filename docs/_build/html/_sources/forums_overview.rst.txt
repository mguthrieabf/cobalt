Forums Overview
===============

Forums handles the general blogging capabilities on Cobalt. This allows
users to communicate with each other, to comment on posts and for clubs
and other organisations to connect with their members and followers.

The codebase for Forums is relatively small and not too hard to understand
by reading the code.

Forums uses RBAC for security. See :doc:`rbac_overview` for more details.
