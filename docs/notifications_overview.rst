Notifications Overview
======================

Notifications is the communication centre of Cobalt. It is how all other modules
communicate with members and is also a notice board for events (actions, not
bridge events) that members may want to subscribe to be notified about.

There are many events that a Cobalt user may wish to be notified about.
For example, they may want to hear when a new post is added to a particular
forum, or when someone replies to a comment that they have made in a forum.
They may wish to be notified when the results become available for an event
they have played in, or when a congress in their area is announced.

A user may have different preferences for how they are notified as well.
One user may want SMS, another email and yet another may only wish to find
out when they visit the website. Of course, some users may not want to be
notified at all and others will want a combination of methods depending upon
what it is they are being notified about.

Notification Types
==================

There are three broad categories of notification:

1. System Broadcasts - Users will receive these regardless of preference. These
are rare.
2.Broadcasts - These are typically emails from the National Body, Clubs, State
Bodies etc. Users may opt out of these through their settings.
3. Named Specific - The calling module will provide a list of names. Users can
choose how they are notified or choose to opt out. For example, Results tells
Notifications that the results for an event are available and who played in the
event. Notifications passes this information on to the member (or not, if the
member opts out).
4. Happenings - These are things that members choose to listen to. For example,
a new Forum post.
5. Personal - These are messages intended for a single recipient.

Notification Methods
====================

* In App Notifications - these are always provided. The user will see this when
the log in to Cobalt.
* Email - HTML format emails.
* SMS - Short messages, often with links to pages within Cobalt.
